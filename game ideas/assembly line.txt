In this game, there would be parts for a machine(maybe a car) coming in on three or more conveyor belts and you have to choose whether that part is required or not. If it is, it is added to the machine that is getting assembled. If you add a part that is already present, the machine's quality will start decreasing and you will get lesser money while selling it(eg: car with 5 tyres). If you miss a part, the same thing would happen(eg: car with three tyres). With each extra part, cost price would increase and selling price would decrease
